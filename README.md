# KG_OpenTrons2.0

This repo stores Keoni Gandall's generic opentrons functions. They are meant to play nicely with random stuff going on about lab, in contrast to a much more monolithic approach. Hopefully, there will be protocols here that are generally useful. 

# Plating
- In plating.py
This script holds a function called "OT2_plate" which takes an arbitrary number of reactions as its input. When placed with a trough with LB, 2 troughs with water, and 1-4 rectangular agar plates, the robot plates the transformation reactions.
